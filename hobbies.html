        <h1>Things I like to do.....</h1>
        <p>I enjoy a variety of hobbies such as reading,painting and listening to music. Each activity brings its own unique joy and relaxation to my life. I get a thrill out of solving problems and puzzles. I also love talking to people, getting to know them and sharing ideas.In music I love listening to all kinds of music except rap. I like reading rom-com and fantasy books. In arts I love trying different mediums of painting- be it oil paint, acrylic, watercolour, soft-pastels, oil pastels, sketching, charcoal- or different crafts such as quilling, origami, decorating vases, painting everyday items etc.</p>
